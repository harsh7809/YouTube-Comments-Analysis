This project is a web application built with Django and NLTK-TextBlob for sentiment analysis of YouTube comments. Users can input a YouTube video URL, and the application fetches all comments using the YouTube API. It then analyzes the sentiment of the comments and presents the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. Additionally, the application generates a pie chart using D3.js library to visualize the sentiment distribution.
